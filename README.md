aoc2017
=====
My solutions to the 2017 advent of code using Elixir/Erlang. 
I started with Erlang and switched to learn Elixir around day 3.

To run, you need to <a href="http://elixir-lang.github.io/install.html">install Elixir</a>

Build
-----
    $ mix compile

How to run
-----
    $ iex -S mix
    Interactive Elixir (1.5.2) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
    iex(1)> Aoc2017.go day
Where <i>day</i> is day number for the problem you want to see the result from.

You can also run
    
    1> Aoc2017.go :all
    
To see all of the results at once.
